(*) Find the last but one element of a list.

(Note that the Lisp transcription of this problem is incorrect.)

Example in Haskell:

Prelude> myButLast [1,2,3,4]
3
Prelude> myButLast ['a'..'z']

位 > :doc init
init :: [a] -> [a]
base Prelude
Return all the elements of a list except the last one. The list must
be non-empty.

位 > :doc last
last :: [a] -> a
base Prelude
Extract the last element of a list, which must be finite and
non-empty.

last . init :: [c] -> c

位 > :doc reverse
reverse :: [a] -> [a]
base Prelude
reverse xs returns the elements of xs in
reverse order. xs must be finite.
